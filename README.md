# WellMed-Barriers-to-Care
PURPOSE
To clean, organize, and analyze de-identified demographic data for the WellMed patient population. Results of analyses will help to identify disparities in life expectancy and/or barriers to care that can be targeted by clinical interventions.

INTRODUCTION
Social determinants of health (SDOH) are defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as the “conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play that affect a wide range of health and quality-of life risks and outcomes” [1]. SDOH currently recognized as factors with the potential to influence an individual’s life expectancy include one’s environment, socioeconomic status (SES), race/ethnicity, biological sex, and age [2]. While existing research has already shown that residents of rural areas experience worse health status than residents of urban areas, little research exists examining the potential differences in health status and life expectancy among individuals of neighboring counties/zip-codes, such as individuals belonging to a single patient population [3]. 
The University of North Texas Health Science Center (HSC) houses a WellMed clinic within the HSC Center for Older Adults. This clinic primarily serves dually eligible Medicaid and Medicare patients, who may be at a greater risk of experiencing barriers which may inhibit their ability to receive adequate healthcare. 
Using the County Health Rankings Model, clinical care accounts for 20% of a person’s health outcome, with the remaining 80% derived from health behaviors, social and economic factors, and a person’s physical environment [4]. This does not mean, however, that we cannot apply interventions in the clinical setting to target barriers to care caused by non-clinical SDOH. In fact, this approach may be imperative to meet select Healthy People 2030 objectives, such as AHS-04 (“Reduce the proportion of people who can’t get medical care when they need it”) and AHS-R01 (“Increase the ability of primary care and behavioral health professionals to provide more high-quality care to patients who need it”) [5, 6]. By characterizing the SDOH which may act as barriers to healthcare (i.e., poverty, low health literacy and educational attainment, poor built environment, inadequate access to healthy foods, linguistic and cultural barriers, employment status, etc.), we will be more equipped to design culturally sensitive interventions that are more responsive to the needs of patient populations.
Thus, we have decided to create an aggregate dataset composed of demographic and socioeconomic variables to characterize the WellMed patient population and guide future efforts to tailor HSC clinical practices aimed at reducing disparities in health outcomes and life expectancy among this population. 
As part of this exploratory phase, our main objectives were to 1) better understand the demographic and socioeconomic make-up of the WellMed patient population, 2) determine whether disparities on the basis of life expectancy differ at the county-level, and 3) determine whether aggregate SocioNeeds indices are associated with combined life expectancy.
